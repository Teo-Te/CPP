1      Once upon a time, not a long time ago there was 
2      a boy named Jari who lived in a small village in
3      Greece. Jari got mad at his parents and ran away
4      from home. He ran and ran until he came to a
5      forest. He was very tired and hungry so he sat
6      down under a tree and fell asleep. When he woke
7      up he couldn't find his way home. He was lost.
8      He walked and walked until he came to a house.
9      He knocked on the door and an old lady answered.
10     She said, "Come in, come in. I'll give you some

11     food and a place to sleep." Jari was very happy.
12     He ate and then went to bed. The next morning
13     he woke up and the old lady said, "I have to go
14     to the market. You can stay here and clean the
15     house." Jari said, "Okay." The old lady left and
16     Jari started to clean the house. He swept the
17     floor and dusted the furniture. Then he went
18     outside to get some water. He saw a big hole in
19     the ground. He looked down and saw a big pot of
20     gold. He took the pot of gold and ran away. He

21     ran and ran until he came to a big city. He
22     bought a big house and a big car. He was very
23     happy. He lived in the big house and drove the
24     big car. He had a lot of money. Then his money
25     ran out. He didn't have any money to buy food.
26     So he wanted to go back to the old lady's house
27     and get some more gold. He went back to the
28     forest and found the old lady's house. He knocked
29     on the door and the old lady answered. She said,
30     "You punk kid! I took you in and gave you food
31     and a place to sleep and you stole my gold!" She
32     took a big stick and hit him on the head. He
33     fell down and sadly passed away. Moral of the
34     story: Don't take things that don't belong to
35     you. And also don't be a punk kid. The End.
